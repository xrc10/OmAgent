## üìñ Introduction
OmAgent is an open-source agent framework designed to streamlines the development of on-device multimodal agents. Our goal is to enable agents that can empower various hardware devices, ranging from smart phone, smart wearables (e.g. glasses), IP cameras to futuristic robots. As a result, OmAgent creates an abstraction over various types of device and simplifies the process of connecting these devices to the state-of-the-art multimodal foundation models and agent algorithms, to allow everyone build the most interesting on-device agents. Moreover, OmAgent focuses on optimize the end-to-end computing pipeline, on in order to provides the most real-time user interaction experience out of the box. 

In conclusion, key features of OmAgent include:

- **Easy Connection to Diverse Devices**: we make it really simple to connect to physical devices, e.g. phone, glasses and more, so that agent/model developers can build the applications that not running on web page, but running on devices. We welcome contribution to support more devices! 

- **Speed-optimized SOTA Mutlimodal Models**: OmAgent integrates the SOTA commercial and open-source foundation models to provide application developers the most powerful intelligence. Moreover, OmAgent streamlines the audio/video processing and computing process to easily enable natural and fluid interaction between the device and the users. 

- **SOTA Multimodal Agent Algorithms**: OmAgent provides an easy workflow orchestration interface for researchers and developers implement the latest agent algorithms, e.g. ReAct, DnC and more. We welcome contributions of any new agent algorithm to enable more complex problem solving abilities.

- **Scalability and Flexibility**: OmAgent provides an intuitive interface for building scalable agents, enabling developers to construct agents tailored to specific roles and highly adaptive to various applications.  

## üõ†Ô∏è How To Install

### 1. Deploy the Workflow Orchestration Engine  
OmAgent utilizes [Conductor](https://github.com/conductor-oss/conductor) as its workflow orchestration engine. Conductor is an open-source, distributed, and scalable workflow engine that supports a variety of programming languages and frameworks. By default, it uses Redis for persistence and Elasticsearch (7.x) as the indexing backend.  
It is recommended to deploy Conductor using Docker:
```bash
docker compose -f docker/conductor/docker-compose.yml up -d
```
- Once deployed, you can access the Conductor UI at `http://localhost:5001`. (Note: Mac system will occupy port 5000 by default, so we use 5001 here. You can specify other ports when deploying Conductor.)
- The Conductor API can be accessed via `http://localhost:8080`.

### 2. Install OmAgent  
- **Python Version**: Ensure Python 3.10 or higher is installed.
- **Install `omagent_core`**:
  ```bash
  pip install -e omagent-core
  ```
- **Install dependencies for the sample project**:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- **Install Optional Components**: 
  - Install Milvus VectorDB for enhanced support of long-term memory.
OmAgent uses Milvus Lite as the default vector database for storing vector data related to long-term memory. To utilize the full Milvus service, you may deploy the [Milvus vector database](https://milvus.io/docs/install_standalone-docker.md) via Docker.

### 3. Connect Devices  
If you wish to use smart devices to access your agents, we provide a smartphone app and corresponding backend, allowing you to focus on agent functionality without worrying about complex device connection issues.  
- Deploy the app backend

- Download, install, and debug the smartphone app

## üöÄ Quick Start 
### Hello World
1. **Adjust Python Path**: The script modifies the Python path to ensure it can locate necessary modules. Verify the path is correct for your setup:

   ```python
   CURRENT_PATH = Path(__file__).parents[0]
   sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(CURRENT_PATH.joinpath('../../')))
   ```
   - **CURRENT_PATH**: This is the path to the current directory.
   - **sys.path.append**: This adds the path to the current directory to the Python path. This is to allow importing packages from the examples directory later.


2. **Initialize Logging**: The script sets up logging to track application events. You can adjust the logging level (`INFO`, `DEBUG`, etc.) as needed:

   ```python
   logging.init_logger("omagent", "omagent", level="INFO")
   ```

3. **Create and Execute Workflow**: The script creates a workflow and adds a task to it. It then starts the agent client to execute the workflow:

   ```python
    from examples.step1_simpleVQA.agent.simple_vqa.simple_vqa import SimpleVQA
    from examples.step1_simpleVQA.agent.input_interface.input_interface import InputIterface

    workflow = ConductorWorkflow(name='example1')
    task1 = simple_task(task_def_name='InputIterface', task_reference_name='input_task')
    task2 = simple_task(task_def_name='SimpleVQA', task_reference_name='simple_vqa', inputs={'user_instruction': task1.output('user_instruction')})
    workflow >> task1 >> task2
    
    
    workflow.register(True)
    
    agent_client = DefaultClient(interactor=workflow, config_path='examples/step1_simpleVQA/configs', workers=[InputIterface()])
    agent_client.start_interactor()
   ```

   - **Workflow**: Defines the sequence of tasks. 'name' is the name of the workflowÔºå please make sure it is unique.
   - **Task**: Represents a unit of work, in this case, we use SimpleVQA from the examples. 'task_def_name' represents the corresponding class name, 'task_reference_name' represents the name in the conductor.
   - **AppClient**: Starts the agent client to execute the workflow. Here we use AppClient, if you want to use CLI, please use DefaultClient.
   - **agent_client.start_interactor()**: This will start the worker corresponding to the registered task, in this case, it will start SimpleVQA and wait for the conductor's scheduling.

4. **Run the Script**  
  Execute the script using Python:  
   ```bash
   python run_app.py
   ```  
    **Ensure the workflow engine is running before executing the script.**


### üèó Architecture
The design architecture of OmAgent adheres to three fundamental principles:  
1. Graph-based workflow orchestration;   
2. Native multimodality;   
3. Device-centricity.   

With OmAgent, one has the opportunity to craft a bespoke intelligent agent program.  

For a deeper comprehension of OmAgent, let us elucidate key terms:  

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/architecture.jpg" width="700"/>
</p>  

- **Devices**: Central to OmAgent's vision is the empowerment of intelligent hardware devices through artificial intelligence agents, rendering devices a pivotal component of OmAgent's essence. By leveraging the downloadable mobile application we have generously provided, your mobile device can become the inaugural foundational node linked to OmAgent. Devices serve to intake environmental stimuli, such as images and sounds, potentially offering responsive feedback. We have evolved a streamlined backend process to manage the app-centric business logic, thereby enabling developers to concentrate on constructing the intelligence agent's logical framework.  

- **Workflow**: Within the OmAgent Framework, the architectural structure of intelligent agents is articulated through graphs. Developers possess the liberty to innovate, configure, and sequence node functionalities at will. Presently, we have opted for Conductor as the workflow orchestration engine, lending support to intricate operations like switch-case, fork-join, and do-while.  

- **Task and Worker**: Throughout the OmAgent workflow development journey, Task and Worker stand as pivotal concepts. Worker embodies the actual operational logic of workflow nodes, whereas Task oversees the orchestration of the workflow's logic. Tasks are categorized into Operators, managing workflow logic (e.g., looping, branching), and Simple Tasks, representing nodes customized by developers. Each Simple Task is correlated with a Worker; when the workflow progresses to a given Simple Task, the task is dispatched to the corresponding worker for execution.   


### Basic Principles of Building an Agent
- **Modularity**: Break down the agent's functionality into discrete workers, each responsible for a specific task.

- **Reusability**: Design workers to be reusable across different workflows and agents.

- **Scalability**: Use workflows to scale the agent's capabilities by adding more workers or adjusting the workflow sequence.

- **Interoperability**: Workers can interact with various backends, such as LLMs, databases, or APIs, allowing agents to perform complex operations.

- **Asynchronous Execution**: The workflow engine and task handler manage the execution asynchronously, enabling efficient resource utilization.
