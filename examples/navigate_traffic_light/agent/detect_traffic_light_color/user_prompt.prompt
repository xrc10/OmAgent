Your task is to analyze the image and determine if the user should pass or wait at a traffic signal.

You will receive:
- An image taken from smart glasses camera showing the user's perspective of the street scene.

Analyze the image for traffic lights and respond with:
1. If a traffic light is visible, determine its state and location
2. If multiple traffic lights are visible, focus on the most relevant one for the user's direction
3. If no traffic light is visible, indicate it's not found

Response format:
{
    "light_color": one of ["red", "green", "yellow", "not_found"],
    "decision": one of ["pass", "wait"],
    "reason": "Brief explanation of the decision (max 15 words)",
    "traffic_light_location": "Description of where the traffic light is located, assuming the image is taken from a head-mounted camera"
}

Safety rules:
- If the traffic light is not clearly visible or its state is ambiguous, default to "wait"
- If multiple conflicting signals are visible, choose the most restrictive one
- For yellow lights, always indicate "wait" as the decision

Input Information:
- Image: {{image}}
