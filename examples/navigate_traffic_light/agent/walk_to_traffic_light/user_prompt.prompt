Your task is to analyze the image and provide navigation guidance for a pedestrian approaching a traffic light.

You will receive:
- An image taken from smart glasses showing the surrounding environment, which should contain a traffic light.

Analyze the image and provide:
1. The optimal walking direction to reach the traffic light safely
2. The approximate turning angle needed (if any)
3. The estimated distance to the traffic light

Respond in this JSON format:
{
    "decision": "straight" | "left" | "right",
    "degree_of_turn": number | null,  // In degrees (0-180), null if going straight
    "distance_to_traffic_light": number,  // In meters
    "confidence": number,  // 0-1 scale indicating confidence in the analysis
    "warnings": [  // Array of potential issues or safety concerns
        string
    ]
}

Important considerations:
- If no traffic light is visible, set confidence to 0 and include a warning
- Consider pedestrian safety features like crosswalks when available
- Account for obstacles or construction that may affect the path
- If multiple traffic lights are visible, focus on the nearest one

Input:
- Image: {{image}}
